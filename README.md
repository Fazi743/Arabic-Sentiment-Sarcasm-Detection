# Arabic-Sentiment-Sarcasm-Detection
Official implementation of the paper 'Arabic Sentiment Analysis and Sarcasm Detection Using Probabilistic Projections-Based Variational Switch Transformer.' This repository contains the code for training and evaluating sentiment and sarcasm detection models in Arabic using a Variational Switch Transformer (VST) approach.

**"Arabic Sentiment Analysis and Sarcasm Detection Using Probabilistic Projections-Based Variational Switch Transformer"**

## 📌 Overview
This research introduces a novel approach for sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection in Arabic using a **Variational Switch Transformer (VST)** with probabilistic projections. The model enhances feature representation and context understanding, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
